\chapter{Introduction}


The human body has always been an inspiration for many technologies. Scientists have successfully achieved to understand the mechanics behind different parts of the body and created models that imitate the functionalities of the studied parts. The human brain is one of the most complex organs in the human body \citep{nolte2002human}, and we do still not fully understand its inner workings. Creating machines that can achieve human capabilities such as high-level cognition associated with conscious perception is a human dream since a long time. However, before such a goal can even remotely be achieved, we need to understand how information is processed in the brain, how that would be replicated by machines, and how models of it can be created that target specific functions of the brain and replicate their behavior in connection with other parts of the body.

Due to technical and ethical reasons, neuroscientist may not be able to directly investigate certain parts of the brain and experiment on their responses. Therefore, to avoid experimenting in vivo and at the same time attaining realistic results, an embodied simulation framework like presented in \citet{10.3389/fninf.2022.884180} might be used to simulate the brain at scale in order to capture the contributions of multiple brain regions involved in purposeful actions.

Successfully understanding the processes in the brain that create phenomena such as creativity, dreaming and consciousness crucially depends on efficient and easy to use \emph{neural simulators}, the development of which strongly depends on the interaction between researches from both the fields of computer science and neuroscience. Such interactions may lead to a higher quality of the simulation frameworks and as a result to a better understanding of the human mind. One building block in the neural simulation landscape are tools for the creation of neuron and synapse models, which are the basic processing elements of the brain.

\section{Structural and functional units of the nervous system}

The nervous system consists mainly of two types of cells: \emph{neuron} and \emph{glia}. The neurons are information messengers that use electrical impulses and chemical signals to transmit information between different areas of the brain and between the brain and the rest of the nervous system. Everything we \emph{think}, \emph{feel} and \emph{do} would be impossible without the work of neurons. Glial cells provide support for neurons in the form of nutrients and other chemicals and play an important role in keeping the chemical environment of the brain in a good working condition, for example by taking up left-over neurotransmitters or surplus ions from the extracelluar space.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{src/pic/neuron.eps}
  \caption{\textbf{The neuron \cite[taken from][]{introductiontopsychology}}. Neurons consist of three major components: The \emph{cell body} (also known as the \emph{soma}) is the core of the neuron containing the nucleus of the cell and responsible for keeping it alive. The \emph{dendrites} are a tree-like, branched structure collecting information from other cells and sending it to the soma. The \emph{axon} is a long segmented protrusion transmitting information away from the cell body towards other connected neurons. Moreover, the axon is surrounded by a layer of fatty tissue known as the \emph{myelin sheath}. It acts as an insulator and allows faster transmission speeds of the electrical signal by preventing the electrical charge from shorting out.}
  \label{fig:neuron}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{src/pic/synaptic.eps}
  \caption{\textbf{The synapse \citep[taken from][]{Neurotransmitters}}. Most communication between neurons occurs at specialized structures called \emph{synapses}. The synapse is the area where two neurons come close enough that they are able to pass a chemical signal (\emph{neurotransmitters}) from one to another. The gap between the neurons where this chemical exchange takes place is called the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters are packaged into small sacs called vesicles (blue circles in the figure). Each vesicle can contain thousands of neurotransmitter molecules. When the pre-synaptic neuron gets active, this causes the vesicles to fuse with the pre-synaptic membrane and release the neurotransmitter molecules into the cleft. Once the neurotransmitter are in the synaptic cleft, they interact with the receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, bind with them, and may cause an action to occur in the post-synaptic cell.}
  \label{fig:synapse}
\end{figure}

The whole process of communication between neurons (depicted in \autoref{fig:neuron}) is based on passing an \emph{electrochemical} signal from one neuron (called the \emph{pre-synaptic} neuron) to many neurons (called \emph{post-synaptic} neurons). A received electrical impulse travels through the neuron and a chemical reaction is triggered to transmit the signal to the next neuron. When a signal is received at the level of the \emph{dendrites}, it is transmitted to the \emph{soma} in the form of an electrical signal. If the accumulated signal is strong enough, it may be forwarded to the axon and afterwards to the synapses. Reaching these terminal stations, a chemical reaction takes place, emitting \emph{neurotransmitters}, which are transported to connected neurons across the space between the cells. See \autoref{fig:synapse} for details.

We distinguish three states (or phases) that a neuron can undergo, the \emph{resting state}, the \emph{action potential} and the \emph{hyper-polarization} as depicted in \autoref{fig:action_potential}. In the \emph{resting state}, the interior of the cell contains a greater number of negatively charged ions than the outside of the cell. This imbalance leads to a measurable \emph{membrane potential} of about -55 mV. If the first segment of the axon is stimulated by an incoming signal traveling down from the \emph{dendrites} and if the impulse is strong enough to reach a certain \emph{threshold}, the segment opens its voltage-gated ion-channels, allowing positively charged sodium ions ($Na^{+}$) to enter. This change in electrical charges is known as an \emph{action potential} or \emph{spike} due to the form of the excursion of the membrane potential. Once an action potential is elicited, the number of positively charged ions exceeds the number of negative ions in the segment, and it becomes temporarily positively charged. As a consequence, a similar electrical change occurs in the next segment, allowing the electrical impulse to travel along the axon as a wave until it reaches the synapses. It is important to note here that when the signal passes the next segment, the prior segment's gates close again and the potential returns to its original state.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{src/pic/what-is-action-potential.jpg}
  \caption{\textbf{The action potential \citep[taken from][]{what-action-potential}}: (1) A stimulus triggers a rapid change in the membrane potential, called an action potential (or, due to the shape of the excursion, spike). A sufficient current must be accumulated in the cell in order to raise the voltage above the threshold to start a membrane depolarization. (2) Depolarization is depicted as the rising phase, and it occurs when the sodium channels in the cellular membrane open causing a large influx of sodium ions. (3) Membrane repolarization results from rapid sodium channel inactivation as well as a large efflux of potassium ions resulting from activated potassium channels. (4) Hyperpolarization is a lowered membrane potential caused by the efflux of potassium ions and closing of the potassium channels. (5) Resting state is when membrane potential returns to its resting voltage before being stimulated.}

An important property of the action potential is that it cannot be partial. It is that the neuron either \emph{fires} completely, such that the action potential travels all the way down the axon, or it does not fire at all. After firing a spike, the neuron is not able to instantly fire again due to the depletion of its neurotransmitter vesicles. This is true even if other electrical impulses are being accumulated at the dendrites. This period of \emph{hyper-polarization} is also called the \emph{refractory period} of the neuron.

When an axonal action potential reaches the terminal stations, the electrical impulse signals them to release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters travel across the synaptic space between the terminal stations of one neuron and the dendrites of the others, where they bind to specific receptors. Neurons may have the property of either having an \emph{excitatory} or \emph{inhibitory} effect to their post-synaptic neurons. Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the neuron's likelihood to fire, while inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease the cell's likelihood to fire. Given that different neurotransmitters arrive at the dendrites, the neuron will be influenced by both excitatory and inhibitory signals. The neuron accumulates both types of signals and when the total effect of the excitatory signals are greater than the total effect of the inhibitory signals, the neuron moves closer to its signal transduction threshold. Reaching the threshold, the signal is transmitted via the dendrite and the process begins anew in the next cell.

The efficacy of a synapse between a pre-synaptic and a post-synaptic neuron may change over time and depending on the intensity of the activity transmitted via it, the synapse might either get stronger, weaer, or be removed completely. This changes are subsumed under the term \emph{synaptic plasticity}. The synaptic strength depends on how often the two neurons communicate and may change on short or long time scales. Short term synaptic plasticity refers to the temporal change in the synaptic strength as a form of adaptation to continued activity and wears off over minutes or hours. In contrast to this, the long term synaptic plasticity may last for hours, days or even years and is responsible for storing new information in the brain and thus forms the basis for forming memories and learning.

\section{Neuronal simulation}

A cubic millimeter of mouse cortex contains about $9×10^4$ neurons and $7×10^8$ synapses \citep{faisal2005ion}. This tremendous number of neurons and connections makes it hard to conquer the overall complexity of the brain. Computer simulations can be a helping tool, but they have to be very efficient in simulating the targeted parts and representing the available resources.

A neural simulator is a piece of software that allows the user to specify the behavior of models in a high level language, in mathematical notation, or directly as a computer implementation. To be of maximal use, simulators should implement computationally efficient algorithms and support large-scale modelling and complex biophysical models. In order to minimize the entry barrier and reduce the development time, simulators should come with easy to use user interfaces. Examples for neuronal simulators on the level of single neurons and synapses are NEST \citep{gewaltig2007nest} and Brian \citep{10.3389/neuro.11.005.2008}. Both handle connectivity of the neurons as a Graph $G$ \citep{bondy1976graph} with neurons being the set of nodes $\mathcal{V}$ and synapse as the connections between the nodes $\mathcal{E}$. Neurons and synapses in both these simulators replicate different properties of their biological counterparts.

\hl{Here, the reader might wonder how the many details explained in \autoref{fig:neuron} and \autoref{fig:synapse} can be represented by the simple graph you just introduced. Maybe add a sentence or two about the difference between point and compartment models and that there are different simulators for the different scales.}

For this thesis, NEST was chosen as the platform to test the developed ideas and implementations as it is open source tool and has a well structured and modern architecture. The basic concepts are however general and could in principle be ported to other simulators than NEST.

The \emph{neural simulation tool NEST} \citep{gewaltig2007nest, spreizer_sebastian_2022_6368024} is capable of simulating large neuronal networks with different neuron and synapse models. NEST is written in C++ and employs OpenMP for in-node parallelization using threads and the message passing-interface MPI \citep{clarke1994mpi} for distributed simulations. Its Python interface \citep[\emph{PyNEST};][]{10.3389/neuro.11.012.2008} makes it easy for users to run the simulations. Neuron models may be anything from simple \emph{point neurons} like the \emph{integrate-and-fire} neuron to more complex compartmental neurons. While synapses may either be \emph{static} or have a variant weight that changes over time according to a \emph{plasticity} algorithm. NEST supports a variety of algorithms for synaptic plasticity. Examples for such algorithms are spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term plasticity (STP), or third-factor neuromodulated weight dynamics.

The neural network in NEST is generated from neurons and their connections using high-level API functions in PyNEST. The most essential functions are \texttt{Create()}, which is responsible for creating instances of the desired neuron models, \texttt{Connect()}, which connects the neurons and shapes the topology of the neural network, and \emph{Simulate()}, which drives the state of the dynamic system in time. The type of the synapse model used between the pre-synaptic neuron and the post-synaptic neuron is defined in the \texttt{Connect()} function. \autoref{lst:simple_simulation} shows a simple example of how to create two neurons and connect them using a specific synapse type and run the simulation.\\

Line 6 modifies the initial membrane potentials of the first neuron instance to be at -10.0 mV. In line 8, we create a \texttt{voltmeter} to record the membrane potential of both neurons. In line 11, we connect the first neuron with the second neuron, and vice-versa using the \emph{gap\_junction} synapse model. Finally, we connect the voltmeter to the neurons to record their membrane potential over the course of the simulation in line 15 and run the simulation for 10.0 milliseconds in the last line by calling \texttt{Simulate()}.}, captionpos=b]

\end{figure}

Being a research tool, NEST is constantly applied to new use cases and the set of built-in neuron and synapse models is by definition never complete. In order to not restrict users to only the models that come with NEST, they can create custom neuron and synapse models with the NEST Modelling Language \emph{NESTML} \citep{plotnikov2016nestml, linssen_charl_a_p_2022_5784175}. NESTML allows users to express models by specifying their state variables, parameters, equations, and optionally a procedural description of the state update. Such models can then be used in simulation studies by loading the generated and complied model libraries at runtime into NEST.

NESTML itself is written in Python and consists of two parts: The first is a language specification that is heavily based on the syntax of Python, but also provides domain concepts like physical units and differential equation as first class concepts. Each custom model in NESTML is defined by its name in the \emph{neuron} block of the language and the specified name is used for generating the library code in C++ and for using the model in the simulation script. The second part of NESTML is a tool chain that takes a model description and produces C++ code and the boilerplate code required to compile the model into a dynamically loadable library. The most important function in the Python interface to NESTML (\emph{PyNESTML}) is the function \texttt{generate\_nest\_target()}, which generates an extension module for NEST given one or more \texttt{.nestml} files. After installing the library, instances of the model can be created using PyNEST's \texttt{Create()} function and connected with other elements in the network using the \texttt{Connect()} function.

The minimum required parameter of the function is the \texttt{input\_path} that points to the location of the model. Once the code is generated, the built libraries can be loaded into NEST using the \texttt{Install} function by providing the name of the module (\emph{simple\_module}). Once the model is installed in NEST, we can create instances of the model by calling the \texttt{Create()} function with the model name that was given in the \texttt{neuron} block in the NESTML file.}, captionpos=b]

\end{figure}

If there are no interdependent variables between a neuron and synapse model, as in the case of neurons connected via static synapses or dynamic synapses that only depend on the spikes that are transmitted via them and not on any other factors, the code for the neuron can be generated without specifying the synapse model. An example for the NESTML invocation for this case is shown in \autoref{lst:nestml_without_synapse}. If there are interdependent variables, the code for the synapse and the neuron have to be co-generated together. This case is shown in \autoref{lst:nestml_without_synapse}. The co-generation will create the synapse model code and two variants of the neuron model code, one being the same as in the simple case described above and usable with static synapses, the other having the extended functionality for supporting the provided synapse model. To distinguish between the two generated neuron models in the presence of a synapse model, the code generation pipeline modifies the name of the model that supports the synapse by including the synapse's name in the neuron's name and vice versa. This makes it possible to uniquely identify the models, but the user has to be aware of this and must adapt the calls to \texttt{Create()} and \texttt{Connect()} accordingly.

In contrast to the simple case in \autoref{lst:nestml_without_synapse}, co-generating the code for the neuron and synapse requires the user to provide the relation between the neuron and the synapse in the \texttt{codegen\_opts} dictionary. Installing the new library is not different from the previous case, we simply call the \texttt{Install()} function with \emph{complex\_module} as the library name. The main difference is in the creation of model instances. The neuron model is no longer registered in NEST under the name \emph{"neuron\_model}, but the neuron name is now the concatenation of the neuron name and the synapse name to express the relation between the two. The same name mangling is applied for the synapse models, which becomes available under the name \emph{synapse\_model\_\_with\_neuron\_model}. These name changes have to be manually tracked by the user when calling \texttt{Create()} and \texttt{Connect()}.}, captionpos=b]

\section{Problem definition and task description}

The current workflow when using NESTML as layed out above is unsatisfying for a number of reasons. First, the user has to hand many parameters to the function \texttt{generate\_nest\_target()}. Examples of this are the names of used neuron and synapse models, their occurrence in calls to \texttt{Create()} and \texttt{Connect()}, and the parent class attributes. The same applies to the name changes that are introduced when neuron and synapse models are co-generated and that the user has to keep track of manually, which might become a real burden if a lot of combinations are used. As any given extension module library does not know which models it contains and the models do not know from which library they have been instantiated, users also have to keep track of the module-model mapping by themselves and call the \emph{Install} function appropriately. By changing the pipeline to figure out all these aspect by itself, many run-time errors in simulation scripts could be avoided and especially during the exploratory phase of setting up of new simulation, where models are often exchanged by others, the speed of research could be increased.

The main focus of this thesis is thus to overcome the current restrictions by designing and implementing a fully automated framework for generating NESTML models within PyNEST, conceal the usage of the \texttt{Install} function and the name changes of neuron models, and generally reduce the amount of manual steps in the workflow. The automated framework should \emph{virtually} integrate NESTML into PyNEST, but not alter the PyNEST API itself to keep full backwards compatibility. Virtual integration in this context means that new functionality should be introduced by intercepting the interface function calls ($f$) and either pad their execution by additional function calls \texttt{before} or \texttt{after} the original function call, replace the original call by a different function ($g$), or skip their execution altogether ($\bot$). Mathematically described, each function $f$ in PyNEST is replaced by one of the following execution paths:

\begin{align*}
  f \mapsto & \enspace\bot                                                                       \\
  f \mapsto & \enspace f \circ before                                                                   \\
  f \mapsto & \enspace f                                                                                \\
  f \mapsto & \enspace after \circ f                                                                    \\
  f \mapsto & \enspace after \circ f \circ before                                                       \\
  f \mapsto & \enspace g:\enspace \text{\#replace the call of } f \text{ with } g \in \{before, after\} \\
\end{align*}

The interception logic described here will allow to run a mostly unaltered PyNEST simulation script, but control the execution of NESTML from it and decide in a \emph{just-in-time} (\emph{JIT}) fashion when and which models should be generated, compiled, and instantiated and make all decisions transparent to both the user and the simulation script.

One drawback of the JIT mechanism as explained above, however, is that neuron models might only become available at the point in time when instances of the models are connected using a specific synapse model. To illustrate the problems that might arise, consider the example in \autoref{lst:double_memory}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, literate={LL}{{\Lightning}}1, label=lst:double_memory, caption={We create 100 instances of the \emph{iaf\_psc\_alpha} model and we initlize the values of the membrane potential \texttt{V\_m} from a unifrom distribution. Secondly, we want to compute the synaptic weight of the connection as the value of the membrane potential of the eleventh neuron times 100. Finally, we want to connect all neurons with each other and set the weight of the synaptic connection to the weight computed in line 6. For this to work when using JIT, the random value must be cached on the Python level in order to allow the user to retrieve it while waiting for the code generation pipeline to finish in the background. When the code becomes available, the \texttt{V\_m} values could be copied from Python to C++, but resulting in a doubling of the memory requirements as such small memory allocations usually cannot be re-used efficiently due to fragmentation.}, captionpos=b]]
# Create new neurons
params =  {"V_m": nest.random.uniform(-70.0, -60.0)}
neurons = nest.Create(iaf_psc_alpha, 100, params)

# Compute the synaptic weight from the drawn value
weight = neurons[10].V_m * 100 # LL Where would the value have been stored?

# Connect the neurons
syn_spec ={"synapse_model": "my_complex_model", "weight": weight}
nest.Connect(neurons, neurons, syn_spec=syn_spec)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

\hl{One general thing: You cannot just say JIT. You always have to use terms like "JIT mechanism" or "JIT approach" or "JIT code generation". JIT by itself does not carry enough meaning. }

In a na\"ive implementation of the JIT approach, the neuron model only becomes available (i.e., gets generated and compiled) when \texttt{Connect()} is called and there is no place where the random values for the membrane potential \texttt{V\_m} can be stored. If the user sets the attributes of the model instances by assigning either deterministic or random values in the call to \texttt{Create()}, there are actually no instances to store these and the names and data types of the attributes are only available after the complete code generation of the models is finished. One way out is to let the JIT mechanism retrieve these attributes from the NESTML model description and create a partial version of the model that merely serves as a storage space for the parameter values and hide the access to this temporary storage by intercepting the relevant function calls (mainly \emph{GetStatus} and \emph{SetStatus}). However, this solution comes with the cost of doubling the memory requirements because we would first have to cache the partial version on the Python side and then copy them into the real instances once they become available when either the \texttt{Connect()} or \texttt{Simulate()} functions are called.

A smarter solution to abate the memory requirements between the Python level and the C++ level is to adjust the internal node representation to make the code of neuron models independent of the storage of their parameters and state variables. One way of doing this is to change their class structure to one that uses \emph{vectorization} \citep{nuzman2006auto}. The approach is based on the idea of modifying the data structure representing the created neurons from an array of structures (\emph{AoS}) to a structure of arrays (\emph{SoA}).

My main task for this thesis is thus twofold: First, a wrapper around PyNEST needs to be designed and implemented to support the \emph{Just-in-Time (JIT)} mechanism that reduces the amount of manual steps for users to a minimum. To keep everything backward compatible, the JIT implementation needs to be fully optional and users have to be able to explicitly enable or disable it in their simulation scripts. To achieve this goal, enabling the JIT mechanism should only require very few changes in the simulation script. The second main task is to extend the architecture of NEST's simulation kernel to support a data structure of neurons in vectorized form. This new architecture should supports the parallel and independent processing of neurons in a single instruction, multiple data execution (\emph{SIMD}) fashion. Compared to the current representation of neurons in the \emph{NestKernel}, this should drastically reduce the number of cache misses \citep{ghosh1997cache}, leading to an overall speedup and performance gain during the simulation of large networks.

\section{Thesis Outline}

In \autoref{chap:funds}, I introduce PyNEST and the NestKernel with a focus on the major components involved in supporting both the JIT and Vectorization implementations.

\autoref{chap:jit} dives deeper into the requirements of the JIT mechanism, introduces possible solutions to meet them and explains the chosen solution and contrasts it with alternative approaches. Having the suggested solution explained, I point out the design and implementation decisions. Finally, I willustrate how to enable the JIT mechanism in a simulation script with the help of a walked example and discuss the changes that must be applied to the script when coming from a script that uses plain PyNEST.

\autoref{chap:vec} introduces the data structures and the necessary changes in the NestKernel to support vectorization. Furthermore, I discuss the wide range of optimizations made possible by Vectorization and the JIT mechanism.

In \autoref{chap:perf}, I present benchmark results together with a set of use cases that exploit the benefits of vectorization.

Finally, \autoref{chap:disc} contains a discussion of the solutions that were developed in this thesis and proposes a set of additional implementation ideas that would make further use of vectorization.
